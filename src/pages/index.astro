      <p>
        Well, somehow you reached my blog so you give me no other choice but to
        explain what's all this about.
      </p>
      <p>
        The main idea for this "blog" (like if this thing could properly be
        named blog) is to document my developer journey and post stuff related
        to code and workflows.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2 class="text-xl font-bold">Who i'm you asked?</h2>
      <p>
        I'm just a developer enthusiast who is intrigued by this rabbit hole
        called "code" and that actually does code on his spare time.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2 class="text-xl font-bold">What you will find on this website:</h2>
      <p>- Webdev</p>
      <p>- Dev Workflow</p>
      <p>- Discussions (by me and discussed by me cuz i'm based)</p>
      <p>- Dev Tools</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        If you are only interested about how this blog was made (actually
        relatable) then i leave you the post like here
